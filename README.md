# hardened-photo-server
A hardened, self-hosted photo upload and gallery server written in **C**, demonstrating secure systems programming practices including:

- HTTPS with OpenSSL  
- Privilege separation  
- Strict upload validation  
- JPEG sanitization  
- Logging & observability  
- Containerized deployment (Docker)  

The system can run end-to-end with:

```bash
make up && make demo
```

---

# Features

- Fully custom HTTPS server (no external web server required)
- Secure image upload pipeline:
  - Content-Length enforcement
  - Filename sanitization
  - MIME sniffing
  - JPEG validation & re-encode via libjpeg
  - Corrupt/unsafe files rejected
- Static HTML gallery UI
- Asynchronous logging thread
- Metrics export capability
- Runs as **unprivileged user** inside Docker
- Self-contained, reproducible deployment

# Running the Server (Windows • macOS • Linux • OpenBSD)

The recommended method is **Docker**, so the server always runs in a hardened Linux container.

---

## Windows (Docker Desktop)

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Docker Desktop for Windows**  
2. Install **Git for Windows**  (or clone this repo)
3. Install `make` (via Scoop or Git for Windows tools)

### **Run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cleanos123/hardened-photo-server.git
cd hardened-photo-server

make up        # build image + start container
make demo      # optional automated curl test
```

Open your browser:

```
https://localhost
```

Accept the self-signed certificate.

---

## macOS (Docker Desktop)

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
brew install git make
```

### **Run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cleanos123/hardened-photo-server.git
cd hardened-photo-server

make up
make demo
```

Browse to:

```
https://localhost
```

---

## Linux (Ubuntu / Debian / Fedora / Arch)

### **Install Docker**

**Ubuntu / Debian**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io git make
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

**Fedora**
```bash
sudo dnf install docker git make
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

**Arch**
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker git make
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### **Run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cleanos123/hardened-photo-server.git
cd hardened-photo-server

make up
make demo
```

Browse:

```
https://localhost:
```

---

## OpenBSD (advanced users)

OpenBSD does **not support Docker natively**, so we will run on the OS itself.
**Please look up a tutorial on how to install openbsd as it will be its own seperate thing:**
LINK:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07rSLK_zW-s&t
**Highly Recommend using ssh to do these steps as openbsd configuration is annoying to deal with**

---

# Stopping & Removing the Container

Stop the running server:

```bash
docker stop hardened-photo-server
```

Remove the container:

```bash
docker rm -f hardened-photo-server
```

(Optional) Clean unused Docker images:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

---

# Development (optional local build)

If you want to build the C server *without* Docker:

### Linux or WSL:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libjpeg-dev openssl
make build
make run
```

OpenBSD uses:

```sh
pkg_add jpeg gmake
./build_and_run_httpsetup.sh
```
